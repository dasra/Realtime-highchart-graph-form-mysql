# Realtime-highchart-graph-from-mysql
This project will create a realtime highcharts which shows the total sales per month for year 2016 and 2017 from a database. 

1. crate a nodejs server and install all dependencies required by using package.json file.
2. create your own database so that you can change the sql queries. 
I used opensource github project from the following link to get the basice idea and modified it to use realtime graph. 
The link to the original project is as follows:
